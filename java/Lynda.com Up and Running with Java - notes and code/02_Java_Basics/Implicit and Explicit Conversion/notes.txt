Implicit and Explicit conversion is used when you need to change the data type of a variable

Implicit conversion is used when an equation has more than one data type, such as an int and a double
If you multiply 10 x 15.75 result would be 157.50, implicit conversion automatically includes the fraction

Explicit conversion happens when the programmer exlicitly changes the data type of a variable

temporary conversion
(double)(3 + 5 + 8)/3 - the values 3, 5, and 8 are temporarily converted to a double
