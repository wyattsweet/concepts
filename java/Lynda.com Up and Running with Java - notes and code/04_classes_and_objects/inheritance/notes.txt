inheritance occurs when a new class "inherits" the data and methods from another class
Benefit is you can create a generic class and allow more specific classes to inherit from 
it, plus add more features. Use keywords "extends" and "implements".

Polymorphism
Another benefit of OOP. Sometimes methods need to behave differently depending on the new
class definition. a bug class might have a method move. If it's inherited by a grasshopper move would mean jump,
whereas if it's inherited by a ladybug it means to fly. Polymorphism addresses this issue.
