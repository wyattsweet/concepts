 *
 * Some features of Java –
 * – Concurrency
 * – class based, inheritance achieved by defining classes. It is also 
 * object-oriented.
 * – Designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, so it's 
 * platform-independent
 * – Java applications are compiled to bytecode that can run on a JVM
 * – Incorporates a garbage collector
 * – Derives its syntax from C++
 *
 * – Use Java JDK to compile and run code from the command line without an IDE. 
 *   File has to have the same name as the class, see file Demo.java
 *  Just run $ javac file.java
 *  which compiles the code
 *  then run $ java Demo
