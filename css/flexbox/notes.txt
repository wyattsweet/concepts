What is Flexbox? 

Allows you to efficiently layout, align and distribute elements within your document regardless of 
viewport size.

You start by defining a flex-container on a parent element by using – display: flex or display: inline-flex

parent becomes the flex container and children become the flex items.

There are six items a flex container can take on: 

  - flex-direction: row || column || row-reverse || column-reverse 

The direction in which flex-items are laid along the main axis. Items can be laid out horizontally (main-axis), vertically (cross axis), reveresed, etc.

  - flex-wrap: wrap || nowrap || wrap-reverse;

  - flex-flow: row wrap; /*direction "row" and yes, please wrap the items.*/

a shorthand property which takes flex-direction and flex-wrap

  - justify-content: flex-start || flex-end || center || space-between || space-around

justify content property defines how flex items are laid out on the main axis.

  - align-items: flex-start || flex-end || center || stretch || baseline

defines how flex-items are laid out on the cross axis.  

baseline keeps the bottom of the content aligned in the flex-items

  - align-content

Takes the same values as align-items apart from baseline.
Controls how the flex-items are aligned in a multi-line flex container.
